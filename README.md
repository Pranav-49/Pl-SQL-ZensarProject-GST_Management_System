## Project Created by : 
Raychure Pranav Santosh Student of Amrutwahini College of Engineering from Computer Engineering Department (under Zensar SQL and Python Training)

## Description:
The GST Management System is a database project written in PL/SQL that automates the generation and management 
of invoices with GST (Goods and Services Tax) calculations. The system allows businesses to:

Store product information with their respective GST rates.
Generate invoices dynamically based on product details and customer purchases.
Automatically calculate GST, total amount, and final invoice amounts.
Display detailed invoice information, including product details, customer details, and tax breakdowns.
This project uses Oracle SQL and PL/SQL features such as tables, functions, procedures, and packages, 
and is designed to work on platforms like Oracle Live SQL or any Oracle-supported database system.

## Key Features
Product Management:

A predefined list of products with prices and GST rates.
New products can be added dynamically.
Invoice Generation:

Automatically generates a unique invoice ID for each transaction.
Calculates GST and final amounts dynamically based on product details.
Dynamic Invoice Display:

Displays customer details, invoice amounts, GST, and product-specific details.
Well-formatted output for readability.
Reusable PL/SQL Package:

Contains reusable functions and procedures for GST calculation, invoice generation, and viewing.

## Technology Used:
PL/SQL (Oracle Database) SQL(for queries , stored procedure)

## Conclusion:

GST Management System in PL/SQL automates the process of generating invoices, calculating GST, and managing product data. 
It dynamically handles new transactions, calculates GST based on product rates, and displays detailed invoices. 
This system simplifies GST-related tasks for businesses and is easily extendable for future improvements, 
such as handling multiple products or adding discounts. It serves as a practical example of using PL/SQL for efficient 
database management and tax calculations.
